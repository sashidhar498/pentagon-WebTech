# Fullstack Web Development Journey with Pentagon Space

Hello! I'm currently learning fullstack web development from Pentagon Space. This repository contains various files I've created as part of my hands-on learning experience. These files primarily consist of early exercises and challenges focusing on fundamental web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here are some of the files I've written as part of my learning journey:

* `1stclass.html`
* `challenge1.html`
* `challenge2.html`
* `challenge3.html`
* `challenge4.html`
* `challenge5.html`
* `challenge6.html`
